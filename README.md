# AngularRoute

## Angular 16 has two approaches 1. modular, 2. standalone.

## This app doesn't have app.module.ts because its default standalone app.

1. Just Import "RouterLink, RouterLinkActive" in respective components, the routing will work, refer page1 component and page2 component for reference.
